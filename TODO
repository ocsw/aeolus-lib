TODO:

prune dated files by number

better handling of long errors?
i18n?
pathological cases in getparentdir()?
squeeze // in getparentdir() output?
strange test problems in validcreate()?
actually parse vars on cl, in config file?
queue sendalert()s for non-fatal messages (e.g., skipping many DB dumps)?
allow char devs / fifos in cases where we currently test for -f?
  (but could cause problems with, e.g., rm...)
speed up log rotation/pruning
do more with function settings?
phone-home check for newer version?
  or auto-update?? (e.g., with 2x md5 and global lock)

do more to protect against leading - in settings?
